# AlzheimersDiseasePrediction
Use Machine Learning to Predict Alzheimer's Disease by Using Handwriting Movements

The DARWIN dataset includes handwriting data from 174 participants. The classification task consists in distinguishing Alzheimer’s disease patients from healthy people.

# Information
For what purpose was the dataset created?

The DARWIN dataset was created to allow researchers to improve the existing machine learning methodologies for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease via handwriting analysis.
